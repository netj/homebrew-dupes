        For complete functionality, please modify:
          /System/Library/LaunchAgents/org.openbsd.ssh-agent.plist

        and change ProgramArugments from
          /usr/bin/ssh-agent
        to
          #{HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/bin/ssh-agent

        After that, you can start storing private key passwords in
        your OS X Keychain.
